Title: Explicitly Qualifying Namespaces by Automatically Adding 'pkg::'
        to Functions
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Matthias Nistler
Maintainer: Matthias Nistler <m_nistler@web.de>
Description: Automatically adding 'pkg::' to a function, i.e. mutate()
    becomes dplyr::mutate(). It is up to the user to determine which
    packages should be used explicitly, whether to include base R packages
    or use the functionality on selected text, a file, or a complete
    directory. User friendly logging is provided in the 'RStudio' Markers
    pane. Lives in the spirit of 'lintr' and 'styler'. Can also be used
    for checking which packages are actually used in a project.
