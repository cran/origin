Title: Explicitly Qualifying Namespaces by Automatically Adding 'pkg::'
        to Functions
Version: 0.5.3
Author: Matthias Nistler
Maintainer: Matthias Nistler <m_nistler@web.de>
Description: Automatically adding 'pkg::' to a function, i.e. mutate()
    becomes dplyr::mutate(). It is up to the user to determine which
    packages should be used explicitly, whether to include base R packages
    or use the functionality on selected text, a file, or a complete
    directory. User friendly logging is provided in the 'RStudio' Markers
    pane. Lives in the spirit of 'lintr' and 'styler'.
